\begin{theorem}
	Let \(f\) be a function whose derivative exists in every point, then \(f\) is 
	a continuous function.
\end{theorem}
%
\begin{theorem}[Pythagorean theorem]\label{pythagorean}
	This is a theorem about right triangles and can be summarized in the next 
	equation 
	\[ x^2 + y^2 = z^2 \]
\end{theorem}
%
And a consequence of Theorem~\ref{pythagorean} is the statement in the next 
corollary.
%
\begin{corollary}
	There's no right rectangle whose sides measure 3 cm, 4 cm, and 6 cm.
\end{corollary}

You can reference theorems such as~\ref{pythagorean} when a label is assigned.

\begin{lemma}
	Given two line segments whose lengths are \(a\) and \(b\) respectively, there is a 
	real number \(r\) such that \(b=ra\).
\end{lemma}
